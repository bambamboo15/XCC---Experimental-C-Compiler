# XCC - Experimental C Compiler 
This is supposed to be an understandable, relatively minimal C17 compiler. It will not be tiny though, as the full C17 standard is 500+ pages long!

> It is work-in-progress, at version 0.0.3. At this point, it can only take in a file name, load it, and provide diagnostics throughout the process.
